1. Navigate to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\294100\2393395676\About


2. Open the about.xml file with notepad.


3. Delete all of the text and copy/paste this in the same notepad:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ModMetaData>
    <name>Ancient Eastern Armory</name>
    <author>Geminingen</author>
	<supportedVersions><li>1.2</li><li>1.3</li><li>1.4</li></supportedVersions>
	<packageId>Eastern.Armory.Geminingen</packageId>
    <description>

Bring various weapon and armor from Ancient Asia.
			 
    </description>
    </ModMetaData>
```


This is what it should look like:

4. Save your edit (CTRL+S) and you're done.

PS: If you uninstall/reinstall the mod or the author updates it, the changes will revert. You can get around that by copy/pasting the '2393395676' folder here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods

It will create a local version and you won't have to worry about it unless the mod breaks from a regular update, in which case I will happily update it.
